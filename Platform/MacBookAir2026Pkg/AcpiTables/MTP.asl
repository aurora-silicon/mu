  J813 MTP/DockChannel input transport ACPI device.

  Port of the J414s table.  AppleMtpHid consumes the three DockChannel
  apertures, one firmware-staging memory window and one AIC interrupt from
  _CRS -- it reads no _DSD property, so the _CRS shape and ordering below are
  the actual contract and the _DSD package is documentation plus a cross-check
  surface.  Unlike the J414s table this one declares no GpioIo connections;
  see the note in _CRS for the hardware measurement that removed them.

  Addresses are from this machine's own device tree
  (DeviceTree.j813ap.adt, IPSW 25G76); ADT reg values under arm-io are
  arm-io relative and absolute is +0x210000000, verified against uart0
  (0x195200000 -> 0x3a5200000).

    /arm-io/dockchannel-mtp   reg[1] 0x394b14000  irq/status
                              reg[2] 0x394b30000  remote FIFO-1 config
                              reg[3] 0x394b34000  remote FIFO-1 data
                              interrupts = <1277>
    /arm-io/dart-mtp          interrupts = <1275>   (fault line)
    /arm-io/mtp               reg[0] 0x394600000/+0x88000  ASC wrap
                              mailbox at +0x8000 -> 0x394608000
    /arm-io/dart-mtp/mapper-mtp  reg = 0

  That last one is the entire reason this platform needed a port rather than
  a copy: mapper-mtp's "reg" is the DART stream id, and both /arm-io/mtp and
  /arm-io/dockchannel-mtp/mtp-transport name it via iommu-parent.  J414s uses
  stream 1; J813 uses stream 0.  m1n1's preboot handoff reads the same value
  and programs the same stream, so the two sides agree by construction.

  The fourth memory resource is the multitouch firmware staging window, with
  the same layout as J414s: AddressMinimum is the MTP DART bus address the
  driver sends in command 0x95, AddressTranslation raises it to the reserved
  CPU physical carveout.  m1n1 maps bus 0x1800000 -> 0x10020000000 (1 MiB)
  during the handoff; 0x10020000000 is DRAM base + 512 MiB, below the Mu FD at
  0x10030000000, and reserved from the UEFI memory map by the matching
  MemoryInitPeiLib overlay so Windows never allocates it.  Translation is
  0x10020000000 - 0x1800000 = 0x1001E800000.
