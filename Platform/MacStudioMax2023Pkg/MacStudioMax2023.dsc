  # (NTAS0090) from AcpiPlatformDxe. OFF by default, and off means
  # preprocessor-excluded, so a build without it produces byte-identical
  # firmware rather than merely equivalent firmware. Adds no FFS module and no
  # ACPI table to the FV (the SSDTs are generated at DXE runtime, like ANS0 and
  # DRT0), so expected_ffs_count and the 94-image count are unchanged. Publishes
  # ZERO interrupt resources and touches no CSRT byte -- see
  # NtasiInstallMediaTables() in AcpiPlatform.c.
  # THREE INDEPENDENT FLAGS, one per device -- there is deliberately no umbrella
  # flag, because one flag meant a machine that wanted working speakers also got
  # a camera devnode and its eight memory windows, which is exactly the coupling
  # that makes an experiment unattributable.
  #
  #   MCA0 (NTAS0080)  speakers + headset jack.  The ONLY one that changes a

  #                    "m2-pro-media" ALI2 table when this is 1.
  #   AOPA (NTAS0081)  AOP coprocessor; its driver enumerates the internal PDM
  #                    microphone array as a PnP child.  AIC 631, below 1019,
  #                    identity mapped, no CSRT entry.  Publishes NO pmgr_east
  #                    window, so unlike MCA0/ISP0 it cannot collide with KBL0.
  #   ISP0 (NTAS0090)  FaceTime camera ISP.  AIC 569, likewise no CSRT entry.

  # #if-gated in AcpiPlatform.c, so this define is informational only (it no
  # longer controls compilation); it stays 1 so build manifests report battery
  # publication as enabled in every build, matching the firmware. Adds no FFS
  # module and no ACPI table to the FV (the SSDT is generated at DXE runtime,
  # like ANS0, DRT0 and the media tables), so expected_ffs_count and the
  # 94-image count are unchanged. Publishes ZERO interrupts and ZERO memory
  # windows -- its _CRS is an empty resource template -- so it allocates no
  # GSIV, touches no CSRT byte, and cannot collide with SMCG's exclusive claim
  # on the SMC ASC and SRAM windows. See NtasiInstallBatteryTable() in

  # without it produces byte-identical firmware. The device itself (NTAS0070,
  # its six MMIO windows and its _DSD) is published unconditionally and is
  # unaffected by this switch.
  #
  # OFF is not timidity. Publishing a resource is a promise PnP must keep: if
  # any one of the five cannot be routed, NTAS0070 does not start at all, and
  # the AppleDisplay driver's entire design rule is that every failure leaves
  # BasicDisplay owning the panel. Without interrupts the driver selects
  # bounded polling and still works; with an unroutable line it does not start.
