  # J413 (M5) exposes usb-drd0, usb-drd1 and usb-drd3 -- no usb-drd2. m1n1 brings
  # up all three (USB0/USB1/USB3). These PCDs are used as a loop *bound*, so the
  # non-contiguous indexing cannot be expressed exactly; 4 covers 0..3, and the
  # absent usb-drd2 is skipped harmlessly by the node-presence check in
  # AppleDartIoMmuDxe / AppleUsbTypeCBringupDxe. At the previous value of 2,
  # usb-drd3 was unreachable, leaving only one candidate port for boot media.
  # Unread by any code -- declared in AppleSiliconPkg.dec and set here and in the
  # other platform DSCs, but nothing consumes it. Kept consistent for clarity.
  # J413 / T8142 values resolved from the live DeviceTree.j413ap ADT in the
  # 26.6.1 (25G76) IPSW. AppleNANDStorageDxe resolves the domain by exact name
  # again at runtime and treats these values only as a write-safety cross-check.
  # T8142 calls the controller domain "ANS" (not "ANS2") and has no
  # APCIE_ST1_SYS domain, so that unused expectation is deliberately zero.
  # The physical ANS NVMe line is ADT interrupt[4] == 1155. It cannot be
  # published directly as a Windows GSIV: 1155 lies in GIC's reserved
  # 1024..4095 range, and a devnode that names it comes up problem=12
  # (CM_PROB_NO_VALID_LOG_CONFIG) with its driver never loaded.
  #
  # J413 has the alias contract this used to wait for, but it is not ALI2:
  # there is no built CSRT here and HalExtAppleInterruptController never loads,
  # so the guest stays on m1n1's emulated GICv3 carrier for its whole life and
  # m1n1 is the only thing translating between AIC lines and guest INTIDs.
  # The table is hv_aic_aliases_t8142 in m1n1's src/hv_aic_alias.c, and these
  # two values must stay equal to the {published, physical} pair it holds for
  # ans -- Mu publishes the GSIV, m1n1 performs the renumbering, and neither
  # can discover the other's choice at runtime.
  #
  # 996 was measured free, not assumed: 443 distinct lines appear in ADT
  # `interrupts` properties on this machine and none of them is 996. Publishing
  # a number that is also a live line would deliver another device's interrupts
  # under ANS0's INTID, because injection is the identity on an alias miss.

# Deliberately after the includes: the last assignment to a PCD wins, and
# MacBookAirFamily.dsc.inc sets these to 0. A block placed above !include is
# silently overridden by the family default, which is exactly how the first
# attempt at this failed.
#
# J413's panel is 2560 x 1664. The family default of 0 means "use the highest
# mode the GOP offers", which lands on that native mode, where an EFI_GLYPH is
# 8 x 19 physical pixels -- legible on a 1080p monitor, not on this one.
#
# SimpleFbDxe publishes integer-downscaled modes that replicate each logical
# pixel into an N x N block, so selecting the 1/2 mode here doubles every glyph
# to 16 x 38 physical pixels while still covering the whole display (160
# columns x 43 rows). Panel geometry is per-machine, which is why this override
# lives in the J413 platform and not in the shared family include.
#
# NOTE: this is the mode the OS inherits at ExitBootServices. If a Windows
# display regression is ever bisected to console scaling, set these four back
# to 0 to hand Windows the native scanout again.
#
# T8142 architectural PMUv3 is trapped and virtualized by m1n1 at EL2.  Keep
# the J413 firmware and Microsoft PE images free of runtime instruction patches.

#
# Built only so its .efi can be copied into the RAM disk image as
# EFI\BOOT\BOOTAA64.EFI -- see tools/make_ramdisk_img.sh. It is deliberately NOT
# added to the FDF, so it never ends up in the firmware volume.
#
# Purpose: roadmap Phase 1.3, "load a PE from FS1". Mounting the RAM disk and
# reading RAMDISK.TXT (done, FW-10) only proves DiskIo/Partition/Fat work.
# Executing an image off it additionally proves the Shell can load and relocate a
# PE from that volume, which is exactly what bootaa64.efi will need.
#
# HelloWorld rather than Shell.efi on purpose: launching a nested Shell would
# re-run FS0:\startup.nsh and recurse. HelloWorld prints one line and exits.

#
# Deliberately after the !includes: the last assignment wins, and the family
# include sets its own value. A block placed above them is silently overridden.
#
# J413's panel is 2560 x 1664 and the UEFI console draws glyphs at a fixed
# 8 x 19 physical pixels, which is unreadable here. Halving the published
# geometry gives a 1280 x 832 GOP whose pixels SimpleFbDxe replicates 2x2 into
# the real scanout, so every glyph becomes 16 x 38 physical pixels and the
# console still covers the whole display (160 columns x 43 rows).
#
# The four PcdVideo*Resolution values stay 0 ("use the largest mode the GOP
# offers") from MacBookAirFamily.dsc.inc: with the divisor applied, the largest
# mode already IS 1280 x 832, so nothing needs to name a resolution.
#
# NOTE: this is the geometry the OS inherits at ExitBootServices, and
# BasicDisplay has no other source of it on this platform. Set the divisor back
# to 1 to hand Windows the full 2560 x 1664 scanout again.
#
# DISABLED (set to 1) until scaling is safe for direct-framebuffer consumers.
#
# A divisor of 2 does give a readable console -- measured 1280x832, Mode 4,
# glyphs at 16x38 physical pixels covering the panel. But it publishes
# PixelsPerScanLine=1280 against a scanout that is still 2560 pixels wide with a
# 2560-pixel stride, and that is only coherent for callers that go through
# GOP Blt(). bootmgfw.efi and BasicDisplay do not: they take FrameBufferBase and
# PixelsPerScanLine and write the linear framebuffer directly, so they render
# with the wrong stride. Observed as a blank screen after bootmgfw.efi loaded.
#
# Fixing this properly means keeping the raw panel as the largest GOP mode (so
# GCM_NATIVE_RES hands the OS a coherent framebuffer) while getting the console
# onto a scaled mode some other way than being the maximum -- the mode-ordering
# route in SimpleFbDxe cannot satisfy both at once.
