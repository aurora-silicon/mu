"""Compile and run the host-side Apple RTKit buffer-request regression test.

This wraps Tests/test_rtkit_buffer_request.c -- a standalone, EDK2-free C
program that links the real
Silicon/Apple/AppleSiliconPkg/Drivers/AppleNANDStorageDxe/Shared/
Apple{Asc,Rtkit,RtkitRuntime}Core.c translation units against a fake ASC
mailbox -- so it runs through the same `python3 -m unittest` entry point as
the rest of Tests/, with no EDK2 build and no hardware involved.

It pins the 2026-07-30 J414s/T6020 hardware failure in which ANS bring-up
completed successfully and the ExitBootServices handoff then logged
"AppleANS: RTKit handoff failed: -25" (NTASI_RTKIT_RUNTIME_ERR_BUFFER),
caused by rejecting buffer requests that carry a non-zero IOVA. It also pins
the current Asahi 44-bit IOVA field and the cold-versus-wake ownership rules.
