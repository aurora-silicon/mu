"""Compile and run the host-side ANS PMGR domain resolution regression test.

This wraps Tests/test_ans_pmgr_resolve.c -- a standalone, EDK2-free C
program that exercises the exact name-based PMGR resolution arithmetic
(NtasiPmgrFindDomainAddress / NtasiPmgrResolveAddress /
NtasiPmgrDeviceNameEquals) compiled into
Silicon/Apple/AppleSiliconPkg/Drivers/AcpiPlatformDxe/AcpiPlatform.c --
so it runs through the same `python3 -m unittest` entry point as the rest
of Tests/, with no EDK2 build, no ADT, and no hardware involved.

It specifically reproduces the 2026-07-30 hardware finding (the DSC's
hardcoded PcdAppleAnsPmgr*Base constants resolved to DCS_09/DCS_10 --
DRAM controller power domains -- instead of ANS2/APCIE_ST/APCIE_ST_SYS/
APCIE_ST1_SYS, because they were computed against the wrong "/arm-io/pmgr"
register block) and fails if name-based resolution would ever again
confuse the two.
