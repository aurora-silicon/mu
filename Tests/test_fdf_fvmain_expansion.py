"""Every platform's FvMain module list is one of a small number of known shapes.

Silicon/Apple/AppleSiliconPkg/AppleSiliconFvMain.fdf.inc holds the INF lines
every .fdf has in common, plus the ones that differ, each behind a DEFINE. This
expands the include with each machine's DEFINEs and checks the resulting list --
contents *and* order.

WHY IT PINS SHAPES RATHER THAN MACHINES

It used to record one expected list per platform. With forty-three platforms
sharing one include that meant forty-three copies of a handful of distinct
lists, and adding a Mac meant appending a fifty-line array to a JSON file that
already contained the same array several times over. That is the same
duplication the board packages exist to remove, in test data.

So the expectation is the set of distinct module lists, each with the machines
that produce it. A new machine that matches an existing shape needs no change
here, which is the common case and the one that should be cheap. A machine that
produces a shape nobody has seen fails, and so does one that moves between
shapes -- which is what the test is for.

Order matters, so these are sequences, not sets. The one thing deliberately not
unified is where AppleNANDStorageDxe sits: machines that boot from internal
storage put it after SmbiosDxe, the rest after NonDiscoverablePciDeviceDxe, and
PLATFORM_NAND_SLOT keeps both.
