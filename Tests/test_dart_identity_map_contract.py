"""Host-side contract tests for the DART identity-map fallback.

T8142's usb DART cannot bypass. Measured on J813 over the m1n1 proxy by
writing 0xFFFFFFFF to a TCR and reading back the writable bits:

    usb0 reg[0] TCR writable mask = 0x00000F89
    usb0 reg[1] TCR writable mask = 0x00000F89

TRANSLATE_ENABLE (bit 0), FOUR_LEVEL (bit 3), REMAP_EN (bit 7) and REMAP
(bits 11:8) all take writes. BYPASS_DART (bit 1) and BYPASS_DAPF (bit 2) are
hardwired to zero -- with translation already disabled, with every stream
disabled, after writing UNPROTECT, and written singly. PARAMS2 nonetheless
sets BYPASS_SUPPORT, so the capability bit is not evidence of anything.

The fallback is a four-level identity map, DVA == PA, which keeps the
controller transparent to an OS that has never heard of a DART. Three levels
would reach only 64GB of DVA and DRAM on this part begins at 0x100_0000_0000,
so the fourth level is load-bearing rather than an optimisation.

None of that is visible at build time. A DART that is left translating
nothing looks exactly like a configured one from every register, and the
first evidence is a device that never transfers, so the properties that keep
this failing closed are pinned here instead.
