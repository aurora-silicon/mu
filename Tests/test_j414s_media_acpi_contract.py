"""Fail-closed tests for the J414s media ACPI publication contract.

The media profile publishes three devices whose _CRS is matched POSITIONALLY by
their Windows drivers.  A short list is detected by the drivers and fails
closed; a REORDERED list is not detected at all, and for AppleIsp it would put a
DART TTBR write into a coprocessor control register.  So the window order is a
contract, and it is written down twice:

  * Platform/MacBookProEarly2023Pkg/AcpiTables/Media/{MCA,AOPA,ISP}.asl -- the
    human-readable specification, which the build does NOT compile.
  * NtasiInstallMediaTables() in
    Silicon/Apple/AppleSiliconPkg/Drivers/AcpiPlatformDxe/AcpiPlatform.c -- the
    AmlLib generator that actually ships.

These tests pin the two against each other so they cannot drift, and pin the
three safety properties that a future edit could plausibly undo by accident:
zero interrupt resources, no speaker-render opt-in, and a media flag that is off
in every profile that is not named for it.
