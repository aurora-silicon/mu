/** @file
  J414s AOP (Always-On Processor) internal microphone array ACPI device.

  ==========================================================================
  THIS FILE IS THE SPECIFICATION.  THE BUILD DOES NOT COMPILE IT.
  ==========================================================================
  It is NOT listed in any INF [Sources] section and produces no .aml in the
  firmware volume.  NtasiInstallMediaTables() in
  Silicon/Apple/AppleSiliconPkg/Drivers/AcpiPlatformDxe/AcpiPlatform.c builds
  the equivalent SSDT with AmlLib at DXE runtime, gated on
  NTASI_ENABLE_MEDIA_PUBLICATION.  See ISP.asl's header for why a static table
  was not used and for the string-_DSD omission.
  Tests/test_j414s_media_acpi_contract.py pins this file against that C table.

  This is the only one of the three media devices with no pmgr_east window, so
  it is also the only one with no resource overlap against KBL0 -- see the
  "KNOWN RESOURCE OVERLAP" section of ISP.asl for what the other two hit.

  Originally authored as drivers-side specification in
  the retained AuroraSilicon M2 Pro AOP-audio evidence.

  AppleAopAudio drives the machine's INTERNAL PDM microphone array, which is
  not on the MCA I2S complex at all: it is a PDM front end owned by the AOP
  coprocessor, decimated in AOP firmware, and delivered over the AOP's own
  ADMAC instance.  The speaker and headphone-jack half of the machine's audio
  is a separate device -- see project-mu/MCA.asl and drivers/AppleMcaAudio.

  AppleAopAudio consumes FOUR memory windows, in this exact order.  Keep the
  ordering in lockstep with AppleAopEvtPrepareHardware and the
  NTASI_AOP_RES_* indices in drivers/AppleAopAudio/AppleAopAudio.h:

    0: aop ASC (coprocessor control), 0x2a6400000 + 0x6c000
    1: aop SRAM / mmio window,        0x2a6c00000 + 0x250000
    2: aop_dart (T8110),              0x2a6808000 + 0x4000
    3: aop_admac,                     0x2a6980000 + 0x34000

  THE MAILBOX IS NOT A FIFTH WINDOW.  /arm-io/aop-mbox is at 0x2a6408000, which
  is window 0 + 0x8000 and already inside it; the driver derives the mailbox
  pointer rather than taking an overlapping resource.  This holds on every SoC
  with an `iop,ascwrap-v4` AOP: t8103 0x24a408000, t600x 0x293408000,
  t602x 0x2a6408000, each exactly ASC + 0x8000.

  NO INTERRUPT IS PUBLISHED, and this is a different situation from MCA.asl.
  The AOP's AIC lines are 613/614/615/616 (mailbox), 628 (dart-aop) and 631
  (admac-aop-audio).  Every one of them is BELOW 1019, so unlike the MCA and
  ADMAC lines (1211-1218) they are legal GSIVs under the GIC carrier and would
  need NO CSRT ALI2 alias.  They are omitted anyway, for one reason: the GIC
  carrier's declared SPI count is not something this file can verify, and a
  _CRS the interrupt arbiter cannot satisfy stops the device from starting at
  all.  The driver completes its entire bring-up by polling -- the RTKit/AFK
  handshake polls the ASC mailbox and the capture ring is advanced by a 2 ms
  WDF timer -- so first light does not depend on any of this.  The line numbers
  are published as _DSD properties below so that adding the descriptors later
  is a one-line change with no rediscovery.

  NO POWER DOMAIN.  The `aop` node's `clock-gates` and `power-gates` are both
  empty and there is no `ps_aop` anywhere in t602x-pmgr.dtsi, so -- unlike
  MCA.asl, which publishes a pmgr_east page as window 4 -- there is nothing to
  raise before touching the block.

  SAFETY: this is a CAPTURE device.  Its driver has no render path, publishes
  no render pin, and contains no TAS2764 or MCA code.  It cannot drive the
  speakers.  Nothing in this file should ever grow a property that changes
  that.
