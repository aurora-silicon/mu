/*
 * Closes the SART window completely: clears EVERY entry, including the ones

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM clear_owned().
 *
 * SART is an ALLOW list. An armed entry PERMITS the ANS coprocessor to DMA
 * into that physical range. iBoot's entries cover iBoot's own ANS buffers --
 * memory that Windows reclaims as conventional RAM the moment it takes over.
 * Leaving them armed across ExitBootServices is a standing grant over pages
 * the OS will hand to arbitrary drivers. clear_owned() cannot close them,
 * because it only knows about entries this runtime added.
 *
 * ONLY SAFE ONCE THE COPROCESSOR IS CONFIRMED HALTED. Revoking a grant that a
 * live IOP is DMAing through converts a benign handoff into a DMA fault of
 * unknown blast radius, which is strictly worse than the open window. The
 * caller owns that precondition; this function does not check it and cannot.
 *
 * The readback is the point. A write that the hardware did not take would
 * otherwise be indistinguishable from a closed window, and "we closed SART"
 * would become an assumption in the log rather than a measurement.
 *
 * @param still_armed  Optional. Receives the number of entries that still read
 *                     back with a nonzero flags byte after being cleared, i.e.
 *                     0 when the window is provably shut. Also set on the
 *                     argument-error path (to 0), so a caller never reads an
 *                     uninitialised count.
 *
 * Returns NTASI_SART_RUNTIME_OK when every entry read back clear.

 * own bookkeeping. On 2026-07-30 an ANS-correlated USB3 bugcheck made "did Mu
 * leave a SART entry in a state that could reject DMA?" a question that had to
