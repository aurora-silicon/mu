  Measured T8142 / J813 (M5 MacBook Air) topology and native AIC3 geometry.

  WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR
  ---------------------
  Until now the AIC3 numbers below existed only as prose: a parenthesis in
  T8142FamilyVirtualMemoryMapDefines.h ("AIC (0x381000000)") and a table in
  Readme.md.  Prose cannot be checked by a compiler.  CSRT.aslc carries the
  AIC3 payload as transcribed bytes -- as T602XFamilyPkg's does, and for the
  same reason: a byte stream whose length, checksum and three nested
  sub-lengths all move together is safer transcribed whole than assembled from
  correlated edits.  These #defines therefore do NOT build the table.  They
  exist so that CSRT.aslc can STATIC_ASSERT the bytes it carries against named
  constants, turning "someone regenerated the table for a different SoC" from
  a silent boot failure into a build failure.

  PROVENANCE
  ----------
  Every AIC3 value was read off this machine by m1n1's src/aic.c, which takes
  them from the live Apple Device Tree and from CAP0 / MAXNUMIRQ on the
  controller itself.  m1n1 prints the summary line:

    AIC3 with 1/2 dies, 2400/4096 IRQs, reg_size:40004, config:10000,
    extintrcfg_stride:04a00, intmaskset_stride:04a00, intmaskclear_stride:04a00

  Nothing here is inherited from T6020/J414s or from T8132.  The same values
  are pinned driver-side by ntasi_aic3_t8142_fixture()
  (AuroraSilicon/drivers/AppleAic/aic3_platform.c) and asserted by
  drivers/AppleAic/tests/test_aic3_layout.c.
