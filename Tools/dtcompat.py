"""Rewrite the two cell spellings upstream dtc rejects. Used by Tools/mkdtb.sh.

Asahi builds its device trees with a patched dtc. Two of its tolerances show up
in the vendored trees, both only ever in GPU pstate-tuning properties:

    <34.0>   fixed-point literal   -> <34>
    <-50>    bare negative literal -> <(-50)>

Neither spelling appears in any property Tools/socfacts.py reads -- CPU
topology, memory, interrupt controller, MMIO `reg`, PCIe `ranges` -- so neither
rewrite can change a derived fact. The lookarounds require a cell delimiter or
separator on both sides, which keeps them off string contents such as
compatible = "foo-1.0". Counts go to stderr so the substitution is never silent.
