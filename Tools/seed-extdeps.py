"""Satisfy the host-specific external dependencies Mu does not publish for macOS.

Mu ships BaseTools, iasl, nasm, uncrustify and CodeQL as `host_specific`
external dependencies with binaries for Linux and Windows. There is no
MacOs-ARM-64 in any of them, so stuart_update refuses the host:

    ERROR - ... is host specific, but does not appear to have support for
            Host(os='MacOs', arch='ARM', bit='64')
    ERROR - Otherwise, delete the external dependency directory to reset.

It then acts on its own advice and deletes the extdep directory, which is why
seeding the payload from another checkout does not survive one run.

What stuart actually wants is a <name>_extdep directory containing an
extdep_state.yaml whose version matches the descriptor, plus a directory named
for the host. Given both, it treats the dependency as resolved and never
fetches. So:

  - Tools we have natively (iasl, nasm) get a MacOs-ARM-64 directory of
    symlinks to the host binaries, which is what the build uses anyway --
    build-windows-native.sh already exports UNIX_IASL_BIN and puts Homebrew
    LLVM on PATH.
  - BaseTools gets whatever build-windows-native.sh built from pinned source,
    if that exists yet; the build script symlinks it in on every run regardless.
  - Tools only CI plugins use (uncrustify, CodeQL) get an empty directory.
    Nothing in Platform/ invokes them, and an empty directory is honest: it
    says resolved-for-this-host, not here-is-a-binary.

This does not fake a download. No file claims to be something it is not; the
state file records the version the descriptor asks for, which is the version
whose absence would otherwise be re-fetched forever.
