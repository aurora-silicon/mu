"""Read SoC-level facts out of a compiled Asahi device tree.

WHY A SECOND DEVICE-TREE READER

Tools/dtwindows.py reads `reg` out of the .dtsi *text* and refuses anything it
cannot resolve without cpp. That is the right trade for the per-machine MMIO
windows it generates: those live in a handful of nodes, they are macro-free, and
keeping the tool free of a Linux checkout means CI can check the generated
headers are current.

SoC-family facts are a different shape. CPU topology is spread across an include
chain, PCIe windows arrive through `ranges` with cell counts declared by an
ancestor, and the MMIO map is the union of ninety-odd `reg` properties from
every node under /soc. Answering those from text means reimplementing cpp and
the FDT cell rules. So this reads the compiled tree instead, where every macro
is already resolved and the cell counts are stated by the tree itself.

The trade is that it needs a DTB. That is fine, because unlike dtwindows.py this
is not a build step: it runs once when a SoC family package is created, and its
output is committed as static C and DEC files that are then reviewed and owned
by hand. See Tools/add-soc.py.

BUILDING A DTB

Asahi's tree needs its own dt-bindings headers and is built with a patched dtc
that tolerates two spellings upstream rejects. Tools/mkdtb.sh does both.
