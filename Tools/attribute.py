"""Say who wrote each file, from the git history rather than from habit.

THE PROBLEM

These trees credit AppleWOA (now NT-for-ASi) in files AppleWOA never had, and
credit nobody in hundreds of files Aurora Silicon wrote outright. Both happened
the same way: a header travels with a copy-paste, and a new file starts from an
old one. Neither is a claim anyone made on purpose, which is exactly why it has
to be fixed from evidence instead of from memory.

WHAT DECIDES IT

The fork point. Every file is one of three things:

  upstream   present in the upstream tree at the fork point. Their copyright
             stands. Aurora's is added only where we have actually changed it.
  derived    we added it, but its content matches an upstream file -- a copy,
             a move, or a template for a new SoC. Both copyrights, theirs
             first, because that is the order the work happened in.
  ours       we added it and no upstream file resembles it. Aurora alone. If
             it carries an AppleWOA line, that line is a travelled header and
             is removed.

"Resembles" is measured, not guessed: difflib ratio against the best-matching
upstream file with the same basename, threshold 0.5.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO

It never removes a copyright from a file classed upstream or derived, and it
never adds Aurora's to a file we have not touched. Attribution is only worth
fixing if the fix is itself accurate.
