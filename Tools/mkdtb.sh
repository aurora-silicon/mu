# Compile a vendored Asahi device tree to a DTB.
#
# Tools/socfacts.py and Tools/add-soc.py read compiled trees rather than .dtsi
# text, because SoC-level facts are spread across an include chain and depend on
# cell counts the tree itself declares. This turns the vendored sources under
# Silicon/Apple/AppleSiliconPkg/DeviceTree into those compiled trees.
#
# Everything it needs is vendored: the tree closure and the dt-bindings headers
# both live in that directory, so this needs no Linux checkout. It does need a C
# preprocessor and dtc.
#
#   Tools/mkdtb.sh t8112-j413            -> build-out-devicetree/t8112-j413.dtb
#   Tools/mkdtb.sh --all
#
# Two spellings need rewriting on the way through. Asahi builds with a patched
# dtc that accepts fixed-point cell literals (<34.0>) and bare negative ones
# (<-50>); upstream dtc rejects both. They appear only in GPU pstate-tuning
# properties, which nothing here reads. The rewrite is reported, never silent.
