# Get this tree to the point where it can build firmware.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# `git submodule update --init --recursive` on this tree downloads about 2 GB,
# most of it MU_BASECORE. If another checkout of mu is already on this machine,
# --reference makes that nearly free. But --reference alone is not enough: the
# clone lands on the *reference's* HEAD, not on the commit this tree pins, and
# a nested submodule can end up at a different commit with no warning. That is
# how BrotliCompress ends up missing brotli/c/common/constants.h and BaseTools
# fails to build with a header-not-found error that says nothing about
# submodules.
#
# So this initialises with --reference where one is available, then walks every
# submodule -- including nested ones -- and forces it to the pinned SHA.
#
#   Tools/setup-build.sh [reference-checkout]
#
# With no argument it looks for a sibling mu checkout, then falls back to a
# plain network clone.
